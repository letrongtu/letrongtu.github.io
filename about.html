                            Greetings! I go by the name Andrew, although my full name is Trong Tu. I was born on 18th April, 2003, so I'm currently 20 years old.
                            Currently, I'm in my second year of studies at the Murdoch University,
                            where I'm dedicatedly pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Information Technology with a
                            specialisation in Computer Science. I come to you as a student who has transferred from Swinburne University.

                            My academic background includes a solid foundation in HTML and CSS, along with proficiency in PHP and MySQL, which I acquired during my time at my previous university.
                            This chance offers me a chance to review and solidify my skills, opening the door for the development of polished
                            and expert websites employing these flexible programming languages. This captivating field has ignited my passion

                            Venturing into the realm of coding has kindled an unyielding passion within me. From my first encounter
                            with code, I felt an exhilarating connection to the boundless possibilities it offers. This ardor deepened
                            during my tenure at Swinburne University, where I immersed myself in HTML, CSS, PHP, and MySQL as well as
                            Ruby and Java, uncovering the beauty of constructing elegant solutions to intricate challenges.

                        <p class="description">
                            Becoming a software developer embodies my aspiration to craft impactful solutions for
                            real-world issues. The prospect of shaping technology to elevate lives, optimize processes,
                            and foster global connections fuels my drive. Each line of code brings me closer to transforming
                            this aspiration into reality, propelling me forward on a journey of continuous growth and innovation.

                            Football is more than just a hobby to me; it's a passion that brings excitement and energy
                            to my life. I not only enjoy playing the sport, but I'm also a dedicated spectator,
                            particularly when it comes to the English Premier League (EPL). The EPL's intense matches
                            and competitive spirit never fail to captivate me, and I'm an enthusiastic follower of
                            Manchester United, a club that holds a significant place in the football world.

                            appreciation for the club's rich history and remarkable achievements. The legacy of
                            Manchester United stretches back decades, featuring legendary players and unforgettable
                            moments that have left an indelible mark on the sport. Beyond the pitch, the club's values
